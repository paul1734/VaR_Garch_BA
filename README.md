# A Value-at-Risk Analysis of Gray and Green Energy using GARCH

This repository presents my code for my bachelor thesis in Economics at the Univesity of GÃ¶ttingen with the name "A Value-at-Risk Analysis of Gray and Green Energy using GARCH".

The code is certainly in need of improvement. I coded it with only 1-2 years of Python experiece. Nevertheless, it worked as intended. 

The GARCH (1,1) model was coded manually. The thesis can be viewed as well for those interested in the topic.
